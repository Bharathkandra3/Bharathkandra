	   <h1>Clinical Trial Articles</h1>
          <p>These articles, like clinical case studies, are specifically related to the field of medicine. They describe the implementation, results, and methodology of controlled clinical studies, most of which are conducted on large groups of patients. Clinical trial articles are very long; in fact, their length is usually roughly the same as the original research article. To write clinical trial articles, the writer has to offer expert reliability, high standards of ethics, and a lot of practical work experience, as the articles are usually not written by beginning writers.</p>
       <h2>Commentary/Perspective/Opinion Articles</h2>
          <p>Commentaries are usually short articles that consist of 1,000 to 1,500 words, and they draw attention to, or critique a book, report, or article that is already published. Commentaries explain why the article or book interested the writer and why it might be attention grabbing for the reader as well.</p>
       <h3>Feature Writing Articles</h3>
          <p>Feature articles are in-depth articles that go into great detail about events, topics, trends, or even people. Their goal is to thoroughly explore the topic with interviews and the use of experts or with even the main people involved. They also aim to show a previously unseen perspective on the topic. The main goal of feature articles is to provide enough detail so that the readers or viewers are familiar with every aspect of the story, and it is this type of article that usually wins the most prestigious journalism awards. They also have the highest word count as compared to all of the other types of articles.</p>
       <h4>Freelance Writing Articles</h4>
          <p>A freelance writer is a writer who doesn’t work for a particular company or publication but instead hires out his or her services to various organizations which can be physically located almost anywhere. Most freelance writers are professional writers who take on different jobs for a short time, although they work for themselves and are not considered the permanent employee of any one company.</p>
       <h5>How-To Articles</h5>
          <p>How-to articles are very specific and describe in great detail steps or tips to help the reader do something specific. If you’ve ever read through a recipe, you’ve experienced a great how-to article. Most how-to articles include solutions to problems or answers to certain questions, and they can include everything from showing you how to reload a grocery store price gun to how to connect a game system to your television set. If it describes specifically how to do something and contains numbers or bullet points, it is likely a how-to article.</p>
       <h6>Investigative Articles</h6>
          <p>Considered one of the most exciting types of writing to many people, investigative journalism consists of jobs that aim to uncover the truth about a specific person, event, or subject. It is based on the principle that the final results should be well verified and extremely accurate, not to mention filled with facts only. This can be difficult when you are an investigative journalist because many of the people you are working with are naturally going to be uncooperative or even hostile to the work you’re trying to do.</p>
