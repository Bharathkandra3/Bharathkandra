	 	<h1>Clinical Trial Articles</h1>
	      <p class="big">These articles, like clinical case studies, are specifically related to the field of medicine. They describe the implementation, results, and methodology of controlled clinical studies, most of which are conducted on large groups of patients. Clinical trial articles are very long; in fact, their length is usually roughly the same as the original research article. To write clinical trial articles, the writer has to offer expert reliability, high standards of ethics, and a lot of practical work experience, as the articles are usually not written by beginning writers.</p>
